### **mergeObjectContext()**

It merges the AccountAggregate instance with the NestJS event publisher context.

This is crucial for Event Sourcing in NestJS. It ensures that the aggregateâ€™s events are properly published and handled within the NestJS framework, enabling features like event propagation and side-effects management.

### **commit()**

After performing operations on the aggregate, commit() is called to finalize and propagate the changes.

This step is essential for triggering the events that the aggregate has recorded. It ensures that all changes made to the aggregate are acknowledged and the corresponding events are dispatched.
